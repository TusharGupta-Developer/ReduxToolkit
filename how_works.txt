Detailed Flow of Todo Application

1. Initial Setup

Redux Slice (todoSlice):
Initial State:
todos: An array holding todo items. Each item is an object with properties id and text.

Adds a new todo to the todos array with a unique id and text from the action payload.
removeTodo:
Removes a todo from the todos array based on the id provided in the action payload.
updateTodo:

Props:

editMode:
Boolean indicating whether the component is in edit mode (true for edit, false for add new).
editTodo:
The current todo being edited, which includes id and text.
cancelEdit:
Function to reset the component state from edit mode to add new mode.
State:

input:
Holds the current value of the input field.
Flow:

Initialization:
input State:
Initializes input with editTodo.text if in edit mode, or with an empty string otherwise.
Form Submission:
Handler: addOrUpdateTodoHandler:
Prevention of Default Action:
Prevents the default form submission behavior.
Check Edit Mode:
If editMode is true:
Dispatches updateTodo action with the current id and input value.
Calls cancelEdit to reset editMode and clear the input field.
If editMode is false:
Dispatches addTodo action with the input value.
Reset Input Field:
Clears the input state after the form is submitted.
Form Field:
autoFocus:
Sets focus to the input field if editMode is true, allowing the user to start typing immediately.
3. Todo Component

Purpose:

Displays a list of todos and provides options to update or delete each item.
State:

todos:
Retrieved from the Redux store using useSelector.
Flow:

Display Todos:

Maps over the todos array to render each todo item.
Each todo item displays its text and includes buttons for updating and deleting.
Update Todo:

Handler: handleEditClick:
Sets editMode to true.
Sets editTodoId to the id of the todo to be updated.
Sets input state to the text of the todo to be updated.
Button Click:
When the "Update" button is clicked, handleEditClick is invoked with the selected todoâ€™s id and text.
Delete Todo:

Button Click:
When the "Delete" button is clicked, dispatches removeTodo action with the id of the todo to be removed.
4. Interaction Between Components

Passing Functions as Props:
The cancelEdit function is passed as a prop from the Todo component to the AddTodo component.
This function is invoked in the AddTodo component when exiting edit mode, allowing the Todo component to manage the state and functionality.
